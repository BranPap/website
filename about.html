    <p> Originally from San Diego, California, I am a final-year undergraduate student of Linguistics at 
    the University of Edinburgh, in Edinburgh Scotland. After the completion of my undergraduate degree, 
    I will begin studying towards my PhD at Stanford University.</p>
    <p> When I'm not doing linguistics, I can often be found reading (especially horror), playing video games,
    or visting the theatre. I'm always down for a good coffee-and-books session! I also have an instagram account dedicated
        to my bookish adventures: <a href="instagram.com/branpapbooks">BranPapBooks</a> </p>
    <p> My friends in California call me BranPap, and my friends in the UK call me BPap. I'm cool with whatever!</p>
