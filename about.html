    <h1> About Me </h1>
    <p> Originally from San Diego, California, I am a second-year PhD student of Linguistics at Stanford University. My research so far has primarily examined the intersections between music, identity, and language, though I have been known to stray somewhat into pragmatics, language acquisition, and morphology from time to time.</p>
    <p> I graduated from the University of Edinburgh with a Masters of Arts with First Class Honours in Linguistics in 2020. During my time there, I served as the First Year Representative, Social Secretary, and President of the student Lingusitics Society. I also served as the National Chair of the Undergraduate Linguistics Association of Britain.</p>
    <p> When I'm not doing linguistics, I can often be found reading (especially horror), playing video games (you can follow me on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/bran_pap">Twitch</a>), or visting the theatre. I'm always down for a good coffee-and-books session!
    <p> My friends in California call me Bran or BranPap, and my friends in the UK call me BPap. I'm pretty much cool with whatever!</p>
