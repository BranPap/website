      <h1> Primary Projects </h1>
      <h2> Sally the Congressperson: Interlocutor Agency Modulates the Role of Subjective Social Beliefs in Linguistic Processes </h2>
      <p> My first Qualifying Paper at Stanford (advised by Dr. Robert J Podesva & Dr. Judith Degen) is investigating the role of individuals' gender ideology in the processing and production of gender-neutral social role titles, such as <em>congressperson</em> for <em>congress(wo)man</em>. In this paper, I argue that there are two pathways via which gender ideology is incorporated into the linguistic system, and that they vary as a function of the linguistic task and the agency maintained by interlocutors.</p>
      <h3> Draft </h3>
      <p> You can read the final draft submitted to Stanford as my Qualifying Paper here:</p>

      </ul>

      <p> A previous version of this work has been accepted as a talk at CogSci2022, and proceedings will be made available on my website when possible.</p>

      <h2> The Female Voice in Experimental Child Language Acquisition Research </h2>
      <p> This is a passion project borne out of discussions with my good friend and colleague Annie Holtz at the University of Edinburgh. This project engages critically with the standard practice of using cisgender female voices in the process of stimuli creation in experimental work on child language acquisition. More coming soon! </p>
