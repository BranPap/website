    I am a first-year PhD student at Stanford University. I hope to focus my research on 
         sociolinguistics and the linguistic constructions of personae in contemporary popular music. I also hope to expand
     into the study of linguistic perception of singing, focusing on misheard lyrics and how our social perceptions of musical
     artsists condition what we mishear.</p>
     <p> I completed my Undergraduate degree in Linguistics at the University of Edinburgh in 2020. During my time there, I served as 
         the First Year Representative, Social Secretary, and President of the student Lingusitics Society. I also served as the National Chair of 
         the Undergraduate Linguistics Association of Britain.</p>
     <p> In my free time, I serve as the Head of the Review Team for the new <a href="https://www.ulab.org.uk/joulab">Journal of the Undergradaute 
         Linguistics Association of Britain</a>. </p>
