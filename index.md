# About Me

<img src="Portrait_Sq.png" alt="Cosplaying Steve Jobs" width="200"/>

My name is Brandon Papineau. Originally from San Diego, California, I am a final-year Undergraduate student of Linguistics at the University of Edinburgh, in Edinburgh Scotland, after which I will begin studying towards my PhD at Stanford University. I am particularly interested in sociolinguistics and the linguistic creation of personae in popular music, as well as in morphology more generally.

When I'm not doing linguistics, I can often be found reading (especially horror), playing video games, or spending time with my friends. I'm always down for a good coffee-and-books session!
